# Metacognition Learning Engine

**Learn the Content AND How You Learn Best**

---

## What is Metacognition?

**Metacognition = Thinking about your thinking**

- Knowing **what** you know
- Knowing **how** you learn best
- Being aware of **when** you're fooling yourself

**Problem:** Students often think they know something when they don't

---

## Our Solution

A learning app that teaches **both**:

1. The study content (biology, CS, etc.)
2. Metacognitive awareness

**How?** 90-second learning loops for each concept

---

## The Learning Loop

**For each concept chunk:**

1. **PLAN** - Choose a learning strategy
   - Self-explain? Visualize? Work example?

2. **MONITOR** - Answer a question + rate your confidence
   - "I'm 75% sure I got this right"

3. **EVALUATE** - Get feedback + see calibration
   - "You were 60% accurate - slightly overconfident!"

## Teaching Two Things at Once

**Learning the Content:**
- AI breaks study material into chunks
- Each chunk teaches one concept
- Questions test understanding

**Learning Metacognition:**
- Track confidence vs actual accuracy
- See which strategies work best for you
- Build self-awareness over time

---

## Example Session

**Student uploads:** "Photosynthesis notes"

**Gets 5 chunks, each with:**
- Mini-lesson on one concept
- Strategy choice (self-explain, visualize, etc.)
- Question + confidence rating
- Feedback showing accuracy vs confidence

**Result:** Learns photosynthesis + discovers that "self-explain" works best for them (85% accuracy vs 65% with other strategies)
